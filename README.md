### **What does this do?**

The main usage of this script is to color whispers received and sent with colors of choice through an easy to use configurable file.

In addition to that, it's meant to bring some extra customization such as, switching the message color of a specific character(or group of characters) name...And that's the only extra thing pretty much.

All of this works clientsided. Nothing you sent is changed.

(If you randomly came accross this respository do search "tera proxy" as the script it's meant to be run on it).

#### Usage

1. Install it(duh).
2. Edit `settings.json` to colorize. Me -> Obviously your whispers | Others -> Obviously others whispers | particular -> Name based whispers, you can state them both a single string or array of strings to target as many people you want in different ways.
3. There's some commands below, most of them are useless.
